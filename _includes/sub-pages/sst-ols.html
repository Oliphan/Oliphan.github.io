		Produced by West Pier Studio for Simpson Strong-Tie, the Outdoor Living Solutions family of applications provide tools for deck, pergola and fence planning. They enable a user to design structures to their liking, visualize them in-context with AR on the IOS version, get a report with a breakdown of materials, and locate a dealer to buy the materials from.

	<p>
		I contributed to the .Net-based backend infrastructure and the Unity-based frontend. This involved bug-fixes and implementing new features such as a revamp of the app's offline-mode data synchronization processes and creation of internal management tools to streamline deployments.
